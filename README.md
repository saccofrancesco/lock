## 📌 TL;DR
**Lock** is a local password manager with a sleek CustomTkinter GUI.  
It encrypts all your credentials with a master password, so you only need to remember **one password to access them all**.  
Simple, reactive, and cross-platform — security made user-friendly.

---

## 💡 Why Lock Stands Out
- **Minimal setup** – just run and start managing passwords  
- **Secure by design** – AES encryption tied to your master password  
- **Smooth UI** – reactive CustomTkinter interface with password-hiding features  
- **Curated visuals** – themed with the elegant [Nord color palette](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)  
- **Cross-platform** – works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🔑 Key Features
* **Simple GUI** – Start the app and you’re ready to go.  
* **Reactive UI** – Every action instantly updates the interface.  
* **Password Safety** – Hide input while typing and store securely.  
* **Design Principles** – “Remember one password, access all.”
